		The Raspberry Pi uses a configuration file instead of the BIOS
		you would expect to find on a conventional PC. The system
		configuration parameters, which would traditionally be edited
		and stored using a BIOS, are stored instead in an optional text
		file named config.txt. This is read by the GPU before the ARM
		CPU and Linux are initialised. It must therefore be located
		on the first (boot) partition of your SD card, alongside
		bootcode.bin and start.elf. This file is normally accessible
		as /boot/config.txt from Linux, and must be edited as root.
